As you can see from the data we collected over the past semester, there's been a significant increase in student participation when we implemented interactive elements. John, could you share your observations from the computer science department?

Thank you, Sarah. From what we've observed in CS101 and CS102, students are more engaged when they have hands-on coding exercises. We need to implement more interactive labs and perhaps consider using VR technology for complex algorithm visualization.

That's an excellent point, John. Maria, what about from the psychology perspective? How are students responding emotionally to these changes?

Well, Dr. Johnson, our psychological assessments show that students report feeling more confident and less anxious about the material when they can interact with it directly. We should definitely continue this approach and maybe expand it to other departments.

I agree completely. Let's make this our action item for next quarter: we need to develop a comprehensive interactive learning framework that we can pilot in three departments - computer science, psychology, and mathematics. We should have a follow-up meeting in two weeks to discuss implementation details.

Before we wrap up, I want to mention that the National Education Foundation has expressed interest in our work. They might provide additional funding for expanding this research. This could be a great opportunity for our university.

That's fantastic news! We should prepare a detailed proposal for them. I'll coordinate with the grants office to make sure we have all the necessary documentation ready.""",
