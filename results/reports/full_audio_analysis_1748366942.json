        "text": "company and we have office in Hano and Yangon. We have done jobs four bilateral donors, including giz and multi-ilateral donors. I'm not sure if you know about us before. Yes, yeah, I've not yet directly worked with you, but I've heard. Okay, so perhaps. and maybe we can go straight to the contents of the meeting, is it okay. Okay, and I think you already may be really. with our introductions letter and also the suggested questions. Yes, yeah. I read through them. Yeah, thanks a lot four your time meeting with us. So, yeah, so because GIS is the leading bilateral donor working on the vocational trainings, so we would very much would like to meet with GIS to understand much better about this sector. Yeah, our, the key objectives of our research is to understand the political economy side of this sector, especially with the recent changes in the government and the state structure. So, such as merging of the ministries, removing the district level and the administration. So with the vocational training sector, now we all know that the Directorate of vocational education and training has been moved from Moliza to the History of education and training. So, four example, this is a very important change, is that it may have lots of implications four the performance of the sector as well as the interventions that the donor may need,. To accommodate when they implement their interventions. So we would like to know how this government and the state of vietnam structures may impact the design and also the implementations of giz Tibet activity recently this year and maybe perhaps in the next couple of years. What do you think about it. Maybe I can share with, or I can start sharing with you a little bit about the work that we're currently doing so that you get a bit of an overview. Sure. and so we have something that we call a cluster structure. So there are several different projects that are implemented by GIZED in the area of vocational education and training as well as labor market policy and labor mobility. and we have one bigger bilateral program between Germany and vietnam, which is,. Yeah, so there's one bigger project that is there and which focuses on promoting the cooperation with the business sector in tvet, that's a very important point. the digital transformation in TVAT, greening T-BET and inclusion. So these are kind of like core pillars of the work that we're doing there. and usually we have always a multi-level approach. So we work on the one-hand side at the national level together with the relevant ministries. Departments but we also work together with T-VAT colleges on a micro level as well as sometimes also on a meso level so with provinces and other relevant stakeholders on that level and the idea is always that the implementation of the pilots on the micro meso level are also informing the work that we do on national level and in the support of our partners previously the main partner was the ministry of Labor and Valets and social affairs and Bolisa and. Had you already mentioned, and now DIVET moved to the ministry of education and training as the department four the vocational education and training and continuing education so far. Besides the bilateral program that I just mentioned, we also have some other programs which are currently in preparation that focus more on the side of labor mobility, so international recognition and labor mobility between Europe and vietnam based on high value and. High quality vocational education and training qualifications in some also greener or climate relevant occupations and finally we also have a regional program with that works with asean so basically with the asean Secretariat in Jakarta but also with the different member states of asean which is promoting the regional cooperation and exchange on best practices both in vocational training as well as in labor market regulation so. These are kind of a couple of things where we work in a also in a interconnected way. and so, yeah, as you have already mentioned, the program moved from molisa to now moit. But actually, I mean, so far it's just a very new development. So maybe we cannot fully gorge the extent to which this will change the program. and we're currently in the process of purpose of getting to know the new partners. Reorganization is occurring currently deep at so the director four vocational education training and continuing education is still a separate department in moord but we understand that this might also change in the future again so i think it's still very much work in progress and we have to be just in close exchange with the partners to see what the specific needs are some things that i think are a great potential four the work with moord are that. This opens up the possibility four a lot more permeability between the different education and training levels so we have the general education and then have the pathways going into vocational education and training and pathways going into university education and training and I think there's much more possibility to align the different standards to align the different standards to align the different training programs so that it will be easier four students later on to move in and out of the education and training system. and to move up step by step also in the sense of lifelong learning. I also think that more it has a very strong track record on digital transformation. So I think that there will be some interesting, yeah, new fields of activity to look into digital transformation of education and yeah, to also streamline that between general education, university, education and vocational education and training. and finally, also to align quality management,. and insurance standards between all of the different education tracks and to have a maybe also yeah consistent system between these different versions and we also understand yeah that this might also open up the possibility to further align between the national qualification framework the national skills framework etc so that's maybe a couple of things that i expect to happen the next years based on the restructure right yeah thanks a lot. Yeah four yeah good introductions and also the implications of these recent changes yeah from the government the vietnam side which may affect your programs and projects okay so we so currently de fact they are thinking of the two activities that we have shared with you the first one is the semi-conductor. vocational training, train the trainer pilot to support the capacity building four the tvet trainers to deploy cbta, the competency-based training and assessment in one or two tvet institutions in Hohtimbing City, perhaps at the vocational training center. So in terms of the feasibility with regards to the political economy side,. What do you think how this activity could be feasible we have introduced the ranking from one to six yeah so I guess sorry yeah after you my impression my personal impression would be that it would be a tool so feasible I think there is generally quite a lot of interest in the topic of semiconductor industry it has been in the media of course also a lot there have been some. Supporting decisions also of state management that they want to promote this topic. So in general I think there's a very conducive environment to work on this. But of course it also depends, always depends on what exactly, because semiconductor as an industry, it's big, but what kind of really occupational fields and job profiles are we looking at. and I think this is really essential to understand, to understand where the industries are that require these workers. and then to find the right partners to do it with and maybe to just share with you that we've also been working and developed two modules on semiconductor or like in the framework of the semiconductor industry already. So I think would then in that case also be essential to collaborate well, so in order that we don't do the same thing twice, but just kind of find ways to complement that in a good way. Because often some of the specific competition. That can be needed four assembly and etc. Or four different steps in the production process and assembly process. Often it's rather about adding a module to existing occupational training profiles such as industrial electricians or mechatronics technicians, etc. Rather than to have a full new fledged occupation. Especially since rather on the side of chip design, etc. , it's more on now university level, academic level,. Than a vocational education and training level so i think there needs to be a lot of careful consideration to find something that is really labor market relevant right okay on that side and so yeah if you're interested i'm also happy to connect you with my colleague who has worked with the partners to develop the two modules that we currently have yeah but in general i think it's it's quite feasible and there's a lot of interest then four sure right okay but. Yeah, so you think in general the ministry, especially the directorate of vocational training and education and training, they would support this activity, right. Yes. and also my personal pressure only, of course. Yeah, and also the vocational training college or center, they will also support it. Yeah, I would expect that. Right, but do you think is there any other political activities. economy elements or reason that from any key stakeholder that they may not support this or they may cause more difficulties or challenge if this activity is to be implemented. I would actually not expect it. I would rather think it's more on the technical level, the issue. Really identifying the labor market demand. I think that was much more the question than a question of political economy. Yeah, and also how to deliver the cost that meets the market demand, right. Yeah. Yeah. the technical design of the cost. Right, okay. Okay, so, so yeah, so what is your recommendation to make this activity more. feasible with regards to the political economy considerations. Such as maybe the project can implement some or try to seek the help from the media who can have to explain or do some marketing to help the potential to have the trainees to be aware of this cost, four example. Or maybe the ministry or the directorate devad they can have some working with de facto to draft a very detailed implementation plans with specific targets. Or you may have, I mean this is just some example. Feel free to add in the recommendations. So like during implementation, I think there will be a couple of important. Steps and depending on the phase that you're in of course in the preparation and I think in the identification of what exactly you're going to train and like which kind of task competency or job profile you're looking at it is really essential to work very closely with the business sector I think this is the most essential part in that as well as also in delivery of the training to really make the skills of the graduates very relevant I think of course. As you mentioned, also raising awareness through media and some communication campaigns to kind of get young people or other people who are maybe already active in certain sectors like electronics, etc. Become interested in this kind of program. and then to make it also, of course, to make it accessible and inclusive as accessible and inclusive as possible to really also. and so I think a joint interest also of. the of defect net and in the germ side that want to make all of these training office just right and then finally to support the labor market transition of trainees after they finish the training so to really also understand what kind of job matching or introduction to companies they need I think these are four sure important milestones or yeah considerations in the process. I think it's also good to, of course, engage on national level, but just to keep in mind that in vocational education and training, the development of training programs and modules, etc. Is in the authority and in the scope of responsibility of the TVAT institutions on micro level. So it's not on the level of the national regulatory body. So the training development would still be on a micro level. and then I think the exchange with the national level. Would be much more focused on utilizing this on a bigger scope, scaling it up, etc. Rather than in the microdevelopment. Yeah, I see. Yeah, I see what you mean. Yeah, thanks a lot. and,,, I want, yeah, do you have any questions four Isabella four this activity. Yes, I have a question to,, Isabel. You,, you, you say that you are busy with,,,. developing two models, right. Yes. Yes. Related to the semiconductor. Do you have any number or forecast a number four or forecast a number four focusing training or semiconductor. I mean at nation, why. Because when you develop the model, there's a model. Micro level, but you should base on forecast. So where you can get demand from the market. Mm-hmm. That is a very good question. We do not, like on our side, we do not have a national forecast of, yes, yes. So what we've been starting work with is on the micro level with local T-BAT institutes and local businesses and to base. On the local needs first. But of course, I mean, we would be very much interested to also learn more about the kind of national forecast there. But so far, we don't have any data on that. Okay. Thank you. I think on the academic university level, there have been some estimates that were prepared. But on the vocational education and training level, I'm not aware. But I would like to know. So, four example in some countries, four the forecast, they use a ratio, acceptable ratio, like one engineer, five or six workers. So how do you think that it's working at this moment four us when we try to develop. Trainers, trainers. Yeah. I mean, I know that there are certain methods like that to estimate, but of course it's a very rough estimate because also the kind of the depth of production in every context is quite different. and, well, what we hear currently from businesses, this is of course not a representative survey, but what we hear is that it's on the working level still very much focused on basic assembly. So this might be very different from other country contexts. So I would be a bit cautious with the ratio approach there. But I think what would be, I mean, what would be a great approach if Oswald four A2D, you called it, or also four growth, would be able to work with the Vietnamese partners to conduct such a skills forecast four the same conductor industry. I mean, that would be great. I mean, it would be very much looking forward to also collaborate with you on that. Okay. We would like to know about the changing. But one of the challenges, I think, in our two, suppose, the activity is the sustainable present. At the end, maybe one four one year later, five years later. So,,,. You know that so far four the professional training, we do not have training court. Like a company know text index or people know identity. So four the sustainable four the long term, so we should have, I think, and I think the ministry of education,. Maybe need in the new future to invest in to develop training code four semiconductor. So I would like to know your experience when you develop to develop two models to a model to a model. So your specialist,. Interested in Greening Coat or not. That means that nationwide, they should have a name, they should have a name, they should have a description four the job, which is far. So how do you think about. Okay, let me see if I understood you correctly. So,. Like I understood that you wanted to say that you think that in the future, they need to develop something on national level, not only on micro level, right. Yes. Yeah. I mean, in generally, it just theoretically, I would very much support your assessment there. and I also think in general it's always helpful. In many country contexts, we see that there are sort of framework curricula four certain occupations. and this is the same. Definitely helpful to reduce the time needed four creating training programs on a micro level. Nevertheless, in the current system here in vietnam is that the T-VAT institutes have the authority to develop the training programs. and on the national level, they do not have authority to prescribe training programs four T-VAT institutes. and there's also no national framework curriculum, only the so-called learning outcomes four certain occupations. So I think even though it would probably be helpful to reduce the amount of effort that TIVA institutes need to put into the developing this, I don't currently see any way to create a framework curriculum four a semiconductor in the current framework that we have. In the future, who knows how it might be. But nevertheless, of course, the training programs that are developed on a micro level with TVAT institutions, they can be shared and scaled. But this is usually then a horizontal mechanism. and it's not a it's not vertical so it would rather be then to try to utilize the TVAT network between the different TVAT institutions to disseminate and scale up the training program and I expect based on what we hear I mean from the news etc is that and also from the T FET strategy 2021 to 2030 is that in general the tendency will go towards merging more TTIVET institutions and. Reducing the overall number of tvet institutions. So there might be also the possibility then to have certain T-VAT institutions that will be very specialized in certain training programs and that could host then such a kind of master trainer on certain topics such as semiconductor. and so it would be, I think, quite essential to, yeah, discuss that with the four D-WAD and more to see if they already envision, if any of the T-WAT institutions that they have might. Become such a specialized center, maybe on some of the things that might have then the scaling and dissemination function in the long run. and I mean, this might also connect to some of the concepts that I mentioned in the decision 73 of the prime minister on the tvet network development, where they are envisioning to create regional centers four high-quality tvet implementation or excellent T-VIT implementation and practical training. That might be also a potential connecting point. So but I think in that sense it's important to work together with the national level, though even we don't have any framework curricula of that. Nevertheless, I mean on the learning outcome side, that would be interesting to have a look into that from the semi-contractor perspective. As I said, I think in most cases it's not a separate occupation. It is rather a further development of certain occupations that are already available in this system with specialized upskilling. Basically. So the question would rather be if maybe some of the learning outcomes would need to be revised. Because usually learning outcomes are available four intermediate to college level. So kind of higher level, T-BET, not elementary or continuing education. Maybe that would be also an interesting question, of course, to ask the new ministry what they envision in the future four continuing education if they will also go four the road of developing learning outcomes four that,. Or if it will stay as a non-formal T-VET. Yeah, so just maybe a few thoughts on that. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, thanks a lot, Isabella. Yeah, just a quick question regarding mainstream, the Jesse, the gender, and social inclusion into the design of these activities. So do you foresee any challenge when the programs try to. To integrate or mainstream the JECC requirement when implement this activity. So in terms of ensuring the gender issues and also the vulnerable or marginalized groups, such as trainees from ethnic minorities or people with disabled. Winston had chance to. To be the potential benefit of this program because we understand that maybe the vocational college, they still do not have sufficient equipment or facilities to enable the participation of the trainees, who are people with disabled. Four example, thank you. I think, I mean, there are several barriers there when it comes to full inclusion in the sense of all of the marginalized groups that you mentioned, full kind of equality. I guess they are not only limited to semiconductor industry-related topics, but also kind of a more broader T-GED topic in general. Maybe looking through the cycle a little bit. So when it comes to access, there are several barriers that will. Will be true four also four the so the first one definitely is that I mean what target group are we looking at if you're of course looking at people who would enroll newly into a college level training program of approximately two and a half to three years so usually you look at graduates of secondary high school graduates basically after grade 12 and usually. There's already kind of an access barrier from there because a lot of people, four example, people with disabilities will not be able to finish the 12th grade in the general education framework. So I mean, there's already a barrier there, but even then there's, of course, a barrier to distributing the information about the training programs to everyone equally and informants that are also accessible. But then also if you look rather at the target group, or four example, if you would look at industry technicians,. Electricians or so that would want to have an upskilling course in semiconductor industry. That's a different topic. and there, I mean, in general, our impression is that, of course, also among industry technicians, they are mostly men and mostly not from some of the marginalized groups. So if you would like to then promote gender equality, inclusion, et cetera, in that regard, it would be the question, you know, like, how. How far you can do that in a target group that is already mostly not made of marginalized groups. So that would be maybe then the question of kind of offering bridging courses. So it would be maybe rather a re-skilling approach than rather than up-skilling. So CES or maybe people who have been active in a different sector, what possibilities do they have to get into this sector with either a short-term or long-term training. So these are kind of all the considerations, I think, around access before the training. Then during the training, of course, you already mentioned the infrastructure. So there's, of course, an issue at some schools more than at others. Some schools are already built quite accessible, not perfect, yeah, but still quite more accessible and some are really inaccessible so far. So that very much depends on which schools you're going to work with. But I think the most important barrier during participation is then the. the capacities of the teachers. So usually the teachers have a lot of stereotypes still and not, but they haven't been equipped with the teaching skills that are needed to teach very diverse learner groups. and so in the past, four example, on our side we have worked with also with DVED in the past and some of the colleges to develop further training four teachers on the inclusive teaching skills. So I would also very much recommend that if, four example, the teachers that will. Teach the semiconductor training that they also should go through this further training to ensure that while they teach they also have the pedagogical skills to teach diverse learners in that sense. and I think because if there is an awareness and an attitude in teachers to support also diverse learners, then almost all the other barriers can be tackled. the other barriers are not that important. So four example, if there's a learning classroom on the first floor and the first floor, the. Third floor and before it was always on the third floor but the third floor is not accessible they can also change it down to the first floor but there needs to be some awareness around that to think of all of the small adjustments that can be made to ensure inclusion during the training but I think the most important point actually is then in the last step of the cycle the labor market entry because of course also from the labor market side there are a lot of. Types and maybe pre perceptions, biased perceptions about the skills and competencies of people, of women and four example, a person with disabilities. So I think it's essential that to engage the businesses already during training, to match them already and get, like, let them get to know their trainees and enable also internships or in-company training so that the companies already get to know their trainees and their real skills. and during that, those kind of. Internships and in company training phases to support the businesses in making adjustments at the workplace where they are necessary, four example, four persons with disabilities. and then support also, of course, later on that maybe through some interview training, some soft skills training, etc. , that can be helpful to support that. Yeah, sure, thanks a lot. Yeah, so regarding the question four, number four that in the file we sent you, another activity. I would like to ask you about the broader TIVET reform. So four scaling implementation to national level, based on the australia's competition-based training and assessment model, of course, contextualized four vietnam. So what would you think four the feasibility of this activity. I actually have a bit of a question on that one, because it's a scale implementation to national level,. What exactly do you want to scale. So is it only about the semiconductor T-VET or is it about broader reform topics on quality assurance or green T-BED. Yeah. So this is four the broader reform four like all the sectors, not only the semiconductor. But are there certain topics that you'll envision to focus on or. Here I want to make a clear more clearly about the question. I think we have our four skill, that means previous project, and we have our four skills have achieved some result. About the training about the CPTA, about the training about the CPTA, about the,. industry lead training and chassis at the Ziafaxis mentioned. So now four the new activities, they want to implement broader, wider, not pilot,. Not pilot, but now is admission wine maybe in provinces and in wider and deeper. So some means are not only semiconductor. So they want to disseminate the achievement from the previous program. Adnation YWine. Yeah, thank you four the explanation. Now I understand a little bit better about that activity. and your question was also on the feasibility of it. Is that. Yeah. Yes. I mean, because currently it sounds very broad, it's not very focused yet. I mean, in general, I think it is feasible, of course, but it depends very much on which specific subactivity packages this is,. Involves if it's about scaling of the good practices of the previous phases of all four skills etc it depends I mean if you relate to results of four example developed training programs and trading materials it would apply the same as the things I mentioned before would that it's a challenge that there are no framework curricula but still there is a possibility four dissemination on a horizontal level so that is four sure. and I think because the colleges have also quite a lot of autonomy in the sense of choosing training programs, so it's quite feasible if you have a good outreach and communication to that and if you can show the impact that the training programs had in the previous phases. When it comes to other topic, which are more on national policy implementation or frameworks, like on the level of quality assurance systems, when it comes to the level of business corporate, I mean,. I know in the past, Osfer skills was also involved, four example, on the topic of sector skills councils. I mean, there have also been a lot of collaboration between gas and Osper skills on that side. But there have also been other processes when it comes to, I understand, inclusion that Osper skills was also quite involved in. and of course, there are much more potential leverage points on the national level to further implement. Existing policies and advice on this. So, of course, I mean, it always depends on the time frame that you have available because as you know, or I think you're very much aware that on national level, of course, things move much more slowly than on a micro level. So the question would be also what would be a feasible objective in the time that you have available and how you can connect to other existing initiatives that there are. Maybe to share with you also that on the what we're planning to do in the next years of the national level is we'll focus very much on business sector cooperation. So we need to formalize mechanisms four business sector cooperation, giving the business sector a real mandate and formalized role in that. That would be our advisory approach. Another topic that will focus very much of is the quality management, quality assurance system. and harmonizing the full standards that we have in the system. and a third point, or like a connected point is about this twin transition always there. So kind of like how to connect digital transformation in all its aspects, so when it comes from management administration to teaching, to competencies of teachers, to digital skills, literacy of trainees, et cetera. But to connect that also with the green transition in the same. Sense of further promoting green occupations, especially where we focus on as renewable energy and forestry, but also sometimes we work on construction and so energy and building technology, things like this. So yeah, that would be things that I think will be on our agenda quite a lot in the next years. and so wherever possible, I think that's always good to try to conceptualize it in a way that it very. Together and the third one that I wanted to mention what we're also going to focus on in the future is the tvet image. So to kind of improve the communication around the employment opportunities that vocational education and training will bring and to engage more young people into training. Yeah, I think these are a couple of things. On the side of business sector cooperation, I mean, I think also skills have some very valuable. Experiences that could be further scaled up. Yeah. But of course you also know that sometimes it can, on the national level, of course, advice can be provided on how to improve the implementation of policies, et cetera, but there's of course also limits, because it's always an advisor and that people can take it up or cannot take it up. So it's much more fluctuating than on the microloger thing. Yeah. I understand that this is quite a broad conception and level on the national level so it would take a lot of efforts from not only from the government side but also from donors like yourself, ZSS. So yeah, so it would require quite a lot of efforts and also policy adjustments and advocacy. Not only required the coordination between the ministries and organizations of vietnam, Vietnamese government, but also like any requirement from your side, the donors, the ISS, to support us to achieve more like national level achievements. About that. Yeah, I mean, if I understand correctly, I think what would be really important is that we have a very strong coordination also between the international organizations together with the partners so that we can really be hand in hand four that because I think that we can achieve much more together with the partners. I think, four example, one topic that is not yet very much more. Very prominent in the work that we do, but which would be extremely important four the future is the topic of lifelong learning and recognition of prior learning. I mean, it's also very much connected to the issues of the aligning and harmonizing standards, etc. But I think that would be maybe also, and I understand that australia also has quite a few experiences on this that might be interesting also four vietnam, especially because you have a very. Competence-based approach. So that might be a good opportunity, especially because Steve that has now been merged with the continuing education department in Moad and will also focus on this continuing education of lifelong learning topic more, I think, than in the past. So I think that would be a very valuable addition also on the national level in that sense. and otherwise, of course, we're always. Happy also to cooperate with the Australians and also, I mean, there are always possibilities four co-financing, etc. To work together on different topics and to jointly pool funds into certain projects in order to achieve more impact together. So, yeah. So in terms of feasibility, you say that it's like number two, or one. Or three. I would say somewhere between two and three. Yeah. Okay, let's say it depending. Two point. But it depends very much on the specific topics. I think, like, I mean, just as I said, I think, four example, on digital transformation, there has been a lot of interest in the system. and there are a lot of things that have been moving much faster on the side of harmonizing. Standards, it's a much more complicated topic and a much more, much more stakeholders I involve. It's much, yeah, it requires a really consolidated effort between a lot, a lot of different departments on many levels. So I think on that side, there are much more challenges and implementation. So depending on the topic, it can be, it can be a two, it can be a free, so maybe. Okay, thank you. So how do you think about the stakeholders, like ministry organizations, I can see. That would be particularly supportive four this activity four this activity. I think of course the department of education and training. and participating education is the key stakeholder here four sure. Also together, of course, with the other ministry departments. So I think it's now much more, it will be now much more closely connected to the ministry departments than it may have been in Molesa. So, of course, there are other departments, four example, the department also four digital transformation in the ministry on student affairs, the organizational unit of quality assurance that they have in the ministry. So there are a lot of other departments. That will also play important roles in the tvet reform process in the future. Besides those, of course, what we always advocate four is that the business sector should have an important role in tvet reform processes. So that's what four sure include the BCCI, the vietnam Chamber of commerce and industry. But they might also include other associations of businesses depending on the sectors that you're tackling specifically. Yeah, a lot of different associations out there. Besides that, of course, there are also some other associations and in foundations that might be relevant. So, four example, Varvet and Seoul as an association, I'm sure if you have been in contact with them, they always play also an advisory, an important advisory role in any kind of consultations that might be hosted with public stakeholders or public consultation with stakeholders. and finally, of course, the previously there has been a coordination and exchange mechanism on tvet between different international stakeholders, which was quite important, which we did in the past two times a year. and now there is, I understand, on the moment side, there's already an existing education sector group, which combines all of the stakeholders that have been active in the education sector. On general education, primary education, etc. Entire education, but which is, of course, then also an important stakeholder. and finally, I also understand that there's also headed by Moad, a group on workforce development, more generally, to our like human resource development, I think it's called officially, which can be, of course, an important forum to approach. and finally, I guess, if you're very much looking also into the future. Sectoral topic like the semiconductor, then some of the other minister, land ministries might also be very relevant, like moit, to engage with, yeah, in that sense, or can also even be MOUIC. So there are several ministries that can be quite relevant. Yeah, I want, do you have any questions regarding this activity. I have a comment. Maybe after that and maybe I raised questions. I think the. Between pilot. It pilot activity with the activity. Itably. Is a big, big difference. Isabelle. Isabelle. Isabelle. Have just mentioned because when you upgrade or implement the training program and why, so it's required a lot of things. Elizabeth just mentioned about the quality assurance, about the national qualification system, and how to do it's required a lot of things. level one to level two, not there's three, etc. Access away. So the question here, to Isabel maybe, as a follow. How do you think four. Four example, four implement our achievement, our achievement of national. Why just need or not effort, ministry education, divet and MOUET, MOUET, need to sit together with Molha, in the past, sit maybe with other. ministry of law. We have the ministry of law. Now. Mystri of. and. and. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Because. At nation-wide, we need. We need. Uprate law. and. and. Document. Like I have just mentioned about the training court. I have just mentioned about the access to education and training. and in the future, we need to change. Four example, we provide the training at micro level semiconductor, but we need to think about the change to. To. Skin standards. S. national standard or maybe national qualification standard, excesses unnecessary unnaturally. Otherwise, we may be faced challenging difficulty in implementing in the provinces, not rich like a Pochimic city. When we provide the pilot training in the city, so companies they pay money, they support. I mean here that means we need to think about also the financial circle of national. So, Isabel, so how do you think we need or not. the ministry is to sit together to upgrade education law, the law of vocational,. education, even law of higher education. and also under law like qualification, national standard, something like that. Yeah, I mean, I can only very much agree with you that. I also think it's always important to also be active on the national standard. level in order to ensure more sustainability of all the things that we do, because you're right, if you only do it on a micro level, there are certain limits to what you can do, and you're also right that in some of the localities like the city or hanoi, it will always be easier than in other localities, more rural, have less industry, have no industrial zones, etc. , so there will always be very different opportunities there. and also, yeah, on the sustainability side, of course, if maybe you're pilot a very different. Really nice Australian-based program, but later on maybe the colleges, they don't have enough capacity and financing to maintain the equipment, to update the training program after a couple of years. So yes, it is very important to work also on the national level and on the framework conditions. Though of course it's also challenging to do it. There are, of course, certain challenges due to the long-term commitment that you need on that. and to the speed in which policy processes move. and also, because it's, yeah, as we already said, it's very much interconnected between the education law, higher education, and also all the underlaw ones, and I think there will be a lot of people who are now raining so hard, right. There will be a lot of effort in adjusting all of the underlaw, decrease and circulars, et cetera. Now in the future, now we're going to be a lot of effort. the new setup that we have. So I think there will be a lot of need also four support between Vietnamese partners and the international side. So I think that we'll be also welcomed and I would very much, yeah, I think that more, it would be also very open to the discussion to see with you what areas could be most important. and maybe touching on one thing that you also just said, I think the topic of tvet financing will be very essential also in the future. and as we know in the past couple of years, they have also. Been initiatives to focus more on financial autonomy of TVAT institutes. and, but this is of course very, this provides very different framework conditions four different TVAC colleges. and yes, especially in ones that are urban or close to industrial zones, they have much more potential to also generate income four TVAT institutes through company cooperations. But other tvet institutes might not have. Have this opportunity or also may train occupations that are not very industry relevant. So that might be rather in public service where always. So wages are usually on average lower, et cetera. So I also see a lot of challenges when it comes to the TVAT financing in the future, especially to financial autonomy. and I think that would be something that would be very valuable if it would be advised and tackled to a national level. and yeah. So maybe that would be also a good opportunity four the Osphal Growth program. Okay, thank you. Yeah. So also about the challenge drinks that you mentioned four the broader tvet reform that we were talking about. So if we want to mainstream the Jesse into the scaling implementation on the national level,. So what would you think that, what would be the challenges and obstacles four this activity. I personally think that in general there's quite a lot of openness and interest when it comes to gender equality and inclusion and diversity in the system on national level and I think also in the DEPAD, but also in the moat, there's interest and there are also different. example that more than our can bring into the tibet system that are different from the experiences that Mollisa had before. and I think in general that's also a thing that we often hear from the partners that they are very much interested in this topic. On the other hand side, I personally think that mentioning inclusion and gender equality is not the same as implementing it. and so often it is mentioned very prominently. But I personally feel that there's not yet enough specific action planning and financing behind it, action planning, financing and monitoring behind it to really bring the scale it in the system. So there are also certain TIVA institutions are much better than others, I think, and which could be used as good practices, also on a national level to provide more guidance. and there are certain policies already in place that should support, four example, marginalizing. groups like four example they are four the policy target group possibilities to access in theory training fee reductions or even waivers but it's very difficult to access these because four example the Tibet College needs to apply to their owner either the people's committee or the province or the Minut and Line ministry four the funding four these training fee waivers one year before. It's very hard that if someone wants to then start the training and have access to this fee-fee-bara, it's with a lot of administrative effort that it's only possible. This is what we often hear, and I think there is the groups. So I think there is attention to it. I think there's interest in it, but it needs to have very specific plan, finance and monetary. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You are really. the right point that we have to consider about the financing and the extra planning four this. So yeah, we asked that question focusing on the political economy, not just like about the small aspects like the technical capacity or workforce skills or etc. So would you like to add any recommendations. Recommendations or opinions or anything that you want to add. I mean, maybe on the political column inside, I think it's important to move the topic from a kind of nice to have to an essential part of policy of programming, in the overall sense. But also I think it's important. I think that will be much more dynamic if there is more engagement from the business sector side, from the private sector especially. So if they really communicate their need four workforce and communicate the need also four including marginalized groups, et cetera, more prominently, then there will also be more dynamic behind the implementation of things. So I think that would be something also. To consider them. and I know that in some other countries, four example, ILO has worked with business disability networks where private sectors are engaged in a network to promote employment and skills development of birth to disabilities. and I think initiatives like that would be very much helpful in bringing the topic from a nice to have to a essential topic. Yeah. Yeah. the dynamic aspect of the involvement of the private sector is very important two. Yeah, thank you four mentioning that. time is up. Do you have any other questions four. Yeah, no time is up. Yeah. We already have a very productive one hour with Isabelle. Yes. Very useful. I feel free to otherwise get in touch any time if you have further questions on this. and from my side, I would be also very much, yeah, I would very much appreciate if maybe later on, you could also share once the programming or the project design has further evolved, if you can share any results with us. Because as I mentioned, I also think that this strong coordination is very key. If we can even either combine projects or work very closely together, that's always a great opportunity. Thank you. Yeah, sure. Yes, the donor harmonization is always very important in any country, right. and yeah, it's safe resources and also ensure efficiency across the sector. Yeah, thanks a lot. Thank you very much. We will convey your message to define your. and I hope they would be concerned closely with other donors who are active in this sector, including giz. Thank you. Thank you very much four your time. Thank you. and good. Have a good day. Yeah, you two. See you next time. Bye. Hey, sir. Do you want to say anything. Thank you. Thank you.
